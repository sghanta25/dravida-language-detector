# drāviḍa – South Indian Language Detector 🌍🗣️
# drāviḍa 🪷

**drāviḍa** is a minimalist, web-based language detection tool that celebrates the richness of South India's linguistic heritage. Built using **FastText**, **Flask**, and **pyttsx3**, it detects the spoken language from user input—be it **Tamil**, **Telugu**, **Kannada**, or **Malayalam**—and provides immediate audio feedback in the identified language.

The user interface is elegantly themed with a calming **powder blue** palette, accompanied by floating words in detected scripts, offering an intuitive and immersive experience.
