🪷 drāviḍa – South Indian Language Detector 🌍🗣️

_____

drāviḍa is a minimalist, web-based AI tool that celebrates the richness of South India's linguistic heritage.
Built using FastText, Flask, and a clean front-end, it detects which South Indian language—Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, or Malayalam—is being used when written in transliterated Latin script (e.g., naan unnai virumburen).

Rather than relying on native script or speech, drāviḍa understands the spoken rhythm in written form, making it accessible to a wider audience who may speak but not read these languages.
